# Guidelines for Git Commit Messages and Dry Run Files

- Keep git commit messages short and concise.
  Use the word "problem" instead of "implementation" in commit messages.
  Example: "add greedy algorithm problem" (not "implement greedy algorithm")

- Refer to dry run in: `src/01-warm-up/05_second-largest-dry-run.md`.
  Include only a single test case dry run per dry run file.
